The web app kickstarter

# TL;DR
Prototyping web apps sucks, needed to roll out web 
apps like a boss.

# So whats the big deal?

- PHP driven (as in the easiest way possible)
- Templated with Twig
- All  the whiz-bang js + css libs out there like bootstrap and modernizr

# Install Gus

1) Get source
2) Update $config['app_root'] values to match your server's absolute path for the application application
3) Rage n3wbs
